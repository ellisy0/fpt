> What is this file?

----

The question above is an example prompt, it was saved automatically to this file when the user asked a question in the command line by using e.g. `gpt-cli -q "What is this file?"`, or saved when user issued a `d` (dump) command while in a thread file.

----

> Is this file a complete thread or individual prompts and responses?

----

This file is a "dump" of all the fragmented conversations you want to save, and there are no guarantees if each prompt and response was in a thread or not.

----

> Does this file save the model used to generate the responses, or the timestamp of each message?

----

No, this file only saves the prompts and responses themselves. No other information is saved.

> Can I set up iTerm2 to give me a notification sound once a command finishes and how?

----

Yes, you can set up **iTerm2** to play a notification sound when a command finishes. To do this, you can use the `zsh-notty` plugin. Here's how to set it up:

1. Install **zsh-notty** plugin via **antigen**, **zgen**, or manually by cloning the repository. For example, you can use antigen by adding `antigen bundle jeffreytse/zsh-notty` to your `.zshrc`.

2. In your **iTerm2** Preferences, go to "Profiles" > "Advanced" > "Triggers" and click the "Edit" button.

3. Click the "+" button to add a new trigger, and fill out the form as follows:
   - **Regular Expression**: `^notty:::bell\b`
   - **Action**: "Post Notification"
   - **Parameters**: `Command finished.` (or choose your preferred notification text)

4. Save your changes and restart your terminal session.

Now, whenever a command finishes, you will receive a notification sound.
